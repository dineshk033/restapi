I am always a little wary of strip-mall type motels, because, in my experience, they usually seem to be seedy/druggy/scary. So, when we got there, we asked to see a room first. I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed the night, and not only was the staff (a mother and daughter) very friendly and accommodating, giving restaurant recommendations (try Blue Flame BBQ a few bu...view moreildings away...oh.my.god.), but the room was cleaner than my house (really clean), the second bed had its own locking bedroom, and there was a full kitchen, with a big fridge, pots and pans, plates, coffee and coffee maker, etc. It was 90, including tax, and I was very impressed. This place rocks!view less",

On day 1, we ate at the local pub (there's only 1, so you can't miss it). Once again - friendly folks, great cookin' (and cold beer!). We also toured the many historical buildings there onsite. Wonderfully warm folks - it makes me think how different the world would be if we all treated each other as nicely. So the bottom line - Regent and the Enchanted Castle get two thumbs up.

The first room they gave us was dirty... bed unmade, trash everywhere, etc. We went to the front desk and the lady working was very sorry and very nice, but didn't seem to know where to put us. We are smokers and wanted a smoking room. They didn't have any smoking rooms left, but the owner handed us an ashtray and said...view more it's a smoking room now. I wouldn't mind smoking outside if they didn't have any smoking rooms left, but when I got to the room, I understood why he didn't mind giving us the ashtray. The carpet was atrocious and when I went to take a shower, the handle to turn the water on came off in my hand. The tiles were missing all over the bathroom, the toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. They advertise coffee makers and alarm clocks. Not only did we not have either, there was no remote to the TV either. The smell in the room made me think they had just removed a corpse or something as equally bad. They make you pay in advance and there is no refund, now I know why. They advertise that they have the largest indoor pool in Iowa, however it has been closed for years for improvements. I would NEVER stay there again, or recommend it to ANYONE!view less",

      "reviews.text": "I stayed at the Best Western Luxury Hotel on November 4, 2010. I lodged a complaint about broken furniture that might have caused me an injury. The owner implied that perhaps I broke the furniture. It was a sofa bed in the front room of the suite. I was charged 120.00 for the suite. When I checked in, I was told there was wet bar. When I got in the room, there was nothing, but an empty refrigerator and cabinets, which is not the definition of a hotel wet bar. When I sat on the bed, ...view morethe frame broke. When I tried to get out, it broke again. My roommate had to come and help me get out of thebed. Then the bed could not be put back in the couch. I have had a hip replacement. Sitting on that sofa bed with a broken frame that fell in could have caused damage to my hip. And, that was not all the curtains in the room were too short to cover the entire window so there was light in the room all night. The last straw was that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on while in use. I had to hold the on button to use the dryer, which made it totally useless. Our stay was not a good experience. I have stayed in Best Western Hotels all over the US and never used one with this many problems. When I asked for a reduction in my charge, I was given only a 20, instead of a no charge for the room. I would not have been so disgruntled had the owner, Sarah Patel, given me a free night, but she did not. The hotel furniture was dangerous, did not have the wet bar that it promised, and did not have appropriate window coverings. Sarah Patel, owner of the establishment, provided (1) poor services, (2) unsafe equipment and (3) inoperable appliances. Her business tarnishes the image of Best Western Hotel International and the city of Tracy.view less",

If we could of gotten our money back we would of changed hotels. We stayed in the Jungle room which meant they put about 50 stuffed animals over the bed and hung monkeys from the ceiling. My two year old thought is was cool but my husband and I were annoyed! I understand they were trying to go with a theme but it was very tacky! Please do yourself a huge favor and stay somewhere else!

The sites were amazing, some well know spots but mostly places I'd never heard off, stone circles, ancient tombs, islands etc. Overnight stops were great, accommodations were very good and all centrally located, so no long walks or taxis. The bus was small and very comfortable, reclining seats, air conditioning, lots of leg room and space for day packs. Anything bigger just couldn't get to the places we visited; along tiny, twisting Irish back roads (So glad I didn't drive). The guide/driver was a fountain of knowledge, treating everyone as his new best friend. Stories and info flowed easily and I never felt like I was receiving a lecture. We could stop anytime we wanted for a photo and we had plenty of time at sites; we just all sauntered back to the bus when we were ready. The groups size was limited to 14 so I didn't feel crowded and everywhere seemed off-season!",
